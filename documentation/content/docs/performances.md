title: ParaViewWeb vs ParaView
---
# Performance analysis

This document aims to provide informations regarding the performance you can expect from a ParaViewWeb setup vs similar configuration using the client/server architecture of ParaView and its Qt client.
The test were performed on:

## Idle resource usage

| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| ParaView Qt client         | 344.2 MB          | 540.8 MB               |
| pvserver                   | 22.2 MB           | 57.1 MB                |

| pvpython + pv lib (1)      | 83.6 MB           | 147.4 MB               |
| visualizer (server) (2)    | 123.4 MB          | 195.5 MB               |

__Real Memory:__ Total Memory currently consumed by an application (including Virtual pages)
__Memory:__ Memory used in RAM

## Interactive resource usage

The test was done on the EC2 server using top to monitor the resources taken by ParaView.
The loaded data was the Lidar one which report 228 MB in the information panel.
The filter was a clip which created a new dataset that was 181.3 MB in the information panel.

| ParaView - Visualizer on EC2 | CPU  | Memory                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| Idle                         |   1% | const (6.5%)                |
| Interacting 30 FPS           | 265% | const (6.5%)                |
| Apply a filter               | 100% | const + filter data (10.2%) |

## Loading cost analysis

This section only focus on the intial cost of starting a given process.

|                            | MacBookPro |  EC2 |
| -------------------------- | -----------| ---- |
| ParaView Qt client         |     ~ 2.4s |      |
| pvserver                   |       < 1s | < 1s |
| pvpython + pv lib (1)      |       ~ 1s | ~ 1s |
| visualizer (server) (2)    |     ~ 3.4s |      |
| visualzier (server+client) |            | ~ 4s |

1) Starting Python interpreted and loading the ParaView library.
2) Starting Python interpreted, loading the ParaView library and starting web server.

Then loading data will add-up to those numbers

| Loaded data type  | Load time |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| 1 MB exodus file  |    + 0.4s |
| 4 MB data + state |    + 1.5s |

## Rendering performances

For the rendering performances we've loaded the same dataset of 4.8 Million point cloud and interact with it. The times reported are while interacting leaving the still render out of the picture. In either case the last render does not affect how the tools performance is percived.

__Note__: 

ParaViewWeb target 30 FPS hence the constant 30 FPS value.
When increasing the server FPS value, I was able to reach ~45 FPS with an image of 1280x720 and a JPEG Quality of 50% (Ratio 1 => same image resolution).
When lowering even more the quality of the transfered image I was getting the 60 FPS which was the targeted framerate set on the server side.
